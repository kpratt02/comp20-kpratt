|What is this purpose of this Git repository?														  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|To hold current and past versions of my projects, which I can use to share with others and also as a |
|remote back-up for myself.																			  |			
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?													  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|I really loved Captains Log, because it was cool to deal with an I/O stream and really helped 		  |
|understand the purpose of cookies as well as how to use them. Cookies have always really confused	  |
|me and were something I went into this class thinking were out of my realm of comprehension, and 	  |
|was pretty excited to have figured out their purpose and how to use them.							  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?								  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|I now know how to code in several new languages, how to read source code on a webpage, what and where|
|to look when something is 'broken' online, and how to use Sublime and Git, something I had seen but  |
|never taken the time to understand. I also feel like I am better able, personally, to direct my own  |
|learning and take time to really understand the concepts being covered. 							  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|The most important thing I've learned was to trust myself and my ability to understand things, 	  |
|whether it be something someone else taught me or something I found online. I went in to office      |
|hours on several occasions with the expectation that I was going to be there trying to understand    |
|things for a really long time, then left after several minutes because I had an issue with my        |
|syntax and had actually understood the material itself. I also remember completing an assignment on  |
|my own with time to spare, and feeling incredulous as I submitted it and spending many hours testing |
|and retesting to make sure I actually had done what I thought I did. With that being said, there     |
|were definitely things I could have done better and worked harder on, but I think I suprised myself  |
|a lot with my ability to teach and learn on my own.												  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?		  		  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|I'm really interested in security as well as user experience; I've taken Human-Computer interaction, |
|but would love to learn more about functional web features and look at what people value and look for|
|in a web application! From my psychology standpoint as a CBS major, this is also very interesting.   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Thank you Ming! This was a really tough personal semester and I really appreciated your class and    |
|your accessibility throughout it. 																	  |
