To the best of my knowledge, I have implemented all aspects of this 
project correctly. This program reads in user input, then displays
it on the screen. It uses local storage to ensure the messages will still 
be displayed when users return to the site.

I completely this project alone, using only online resources- 
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18160342/jquery-how-to-trigger-click-event-on-pressing-enter-key
was especially helpful in figuring out how to trigger the event
action.

I spent approximately 1.5 hours on this project.
