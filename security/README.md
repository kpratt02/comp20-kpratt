README for Assignment 4

To the best of my knowledge, I have implemented all elements of this assignment correctly 
in that I have found and identified three areas of vulternability in my partners application.
I have made suggestions as to how they could be fixed, and provided a few topics available for
further discussion.

I collaborated with my partner, John Collins, when we made each other collaborators on the 
assignment as well as to clarify a few technical details about Heroku. Beyond that, I have 
worked completely independently on this assignment. 

I spent around four hours on this assignment.
