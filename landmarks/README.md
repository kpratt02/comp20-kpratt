Assignment 2: Landmarks

To my knowledge, all aspects of this assignment have been properly
implemented. This includes using the navigator.geolocation and XMLHttpRequest
objects to retrieve geolocation and make requests. The map also displays nearby
people and locations, their distance from me, and, when the marker for my 
location is clicked, an info window opens which displays the nearest landmark to 
me. The map also renders a polyline to that location.

I have collaborated with the TA's and Ming on this assignment in order to get 
started. I also used the Haversine formula to calculate the distance, the code
of which is provided here:
